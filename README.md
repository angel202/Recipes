First project. 

This is my first project. I am currently learning basic HTML on February 11, 2022. 

I have some knowledge of programming already, so I am not as new as I think I am. 

I decided to pursue Teach For America and not go into the private sector immediately after collge. 

I am currently working on the ODIN project to freshen up on programming. 

I am starting from the very basics and working myself back up to more complex languages and projects. 

This will be my journey. I will be looking back at this projects a year from now and seeing how much I have grown. 

By the time I read this again I hope to have a full understanding of fullstack development. 

I plan to really focus on the backend but things might change in the near future.
